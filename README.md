# Common-Deal
Online platform to associate vendors with a group of customers. It allows vendors to reach more people and sell items in bulk while customers get lower price.

We decided to separate back and frontend servers. Backend is running on Django REST Framework while front is made in Vue.js. 

There are currently two developers who's been working on this project. We've divided work equally so that we could both work on every aspect of this application.

What I've learned so far in this project is how to properly build REST API with Django REST framework, using authorization, authentication and permission modules, managing images and database records through Django ORM, data serialization, integration with frontend server, how components work and communicate in Vue.js and how to use Vuetify -material design component framework for Vue.
